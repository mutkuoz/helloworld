# helloworld
An artistic and programmatic touch to the majestic "Hello World!", the mother of programming art. A fun project I made when I had a couple minutes spare time. It's entire purpose is to write WikiPedia definition of "Hello, World!" with looping through alphabet and some required punctuations until the correct character comes. I can't think of any way that this would benefit to humanity, maybe it can be used to teach loops to programming beginners.
